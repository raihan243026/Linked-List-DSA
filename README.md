A Linked List is a fundamental data structure in computer science. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, a linked list stores elements at scattered locations, connected through pointers. Each element in a linked list is called a node.

Node Structure
Each node in a linked list typically consists of two parts:
Data: This is the actual value or information stored within the node.
Next Pointer (or Reference): This pointer stores the memory address of the next node in the sequence. In the case of the last node, this pointer is usually NULL (or None in Python) to signify the end of the list.
