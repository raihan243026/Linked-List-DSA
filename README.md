🔗 Linked-List-DSA: An Interactive Data Structure Exploration

Welcome to the Linked-List-DSA repository! This project is a hands-on exploration of the Linked List, one of the most fundamental and versatile data structures in computer science. Dive in to understand its structure, operations, and key differences from traditional arrays.

🧐 What is a Linked List?
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations (unlike an array). Instead, elements are scattered throughout memory and linked together using pointers.

This unique structure offers significant advantages in terms of dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions/deletions compared to arrays.

🧱 The Node Structure
The basic building block of a linked list is the Node. Each node typically consists of two primary components:
1. Data (or Value): The actual information or value being stored in the list.
2. Next Pointer (or Reference): A crucial link that stores the memory address of the next node in the sequence. For the very last node, this pointer is set to NULL (or None) to signify the end of the list.

🖼️ Visualizing the Link
Imagine a chain where each link holds a piece of data and also knows the exact location of the next link. This "knowing where the next link is" is the function of the Next Pointer.

🔑 Key Concepts & Types
Concept,Description

Head,                  ~( A reference/pointer to the first node in the list. This is the entry point for all operations. )~

Tail,                  ~("The last node in the list, identifiable because its Next Pointer is NULL.")~

Singly Linked List,    ~(Nodes only have a pointer to the next node. Traversal is one-directional (forward).)~

Doubly Linked List,    ~(Nodes have two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node. Traversal is bi-directional.)~

Circular Linked List,  ~("The pointer of the last node points back to the first node (Head), forming a loop.")~
